# This is Sean King's responsive portfolio for Homework Two
You will find the portfolio [here](https://seanianking.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/index.html)

The purpose of the portfolio is to exhibit the work done throughout the University of Utah coding bootcamp program, and will be extended to include professional work after the program is finished.

The index page includes the *About Me* section describing myself.
